;
; Welcome to the Catapult tutorial series! (Revision 2, 06/02/04)
;
; These tutorials will take you through the Catapult basics - one by one, and have you
; developing games in no time.
;
; Start with tutorial 1 - and work your way through each. If you find a tutorial is
; not useful, move on to the next one.
;
; Be aware that not every tutorial is an executable *project* (i.e. some of them just
; contain instructions, and are not designed to execute/run).
;
; Each tutorial will explain the commands in the script file, and how to use them.
; Most once complete, will contain a series of 'optional' exercises - things you can do
; to 'muck around' with the script, and get a better feel for how Catapult works.
;
; Check out the user guide for additional information - press F1 at anytime to bring it up.
;
; If you *ever* come across something that just doesn't make sense, or you feel is not
; explained as well as it should have been - drop us some feedback, and we will do 
; something about it! (if you are online, try pressing F12 - this will open the Catapult 
; feedback webpage - send us as much feedback as you want).
;
;
; Ok - onto the first tutorial! 
;
; Click on 'Tut_01_...' in the script browser 
;
; (once you have opened another script, you can use F6 and Shift-F6 to cycle between them,
;  or the left/right arrows in the "Script Browser" window).
