 			    Sample GBA ROMs
			------------------------

===================
 i. What is a ROM?
===================

 A ROM is a binary application, that has been compiled to work on specific hardware (in this case a Gameboy Advance or GBA). GBA's use cartridges to store game data. A ROM can be copied (or burnt) into a cartridge, and can then be played on a GBA.

 The ROMs in this folder have all been built by Catapult, and are demonstrations of how Catapult projects run on a GBA. 


=========================
 ii. How do I run a ROM?
=========================

 There are two ways to run a ROM. 

 If you are lucky enough to have a GBA, a special flash cartridge and a flash linker (an application that copies ROMS into cartridges), you can play each ROM on a real GBA.

 Otherwise, you must use one of the freely available GBA emulators. We recommend using "Visual Boy Advance" which can be downloaded from:

========================================
 iii. How does Catapult generate a ROM?
========================================

 To build ROMS through Catapult you have to buy one of the Catapult packages available (this 'Freeware' version does not built ROMS). Both the 'Development' and 'Licensed' packages include all the software you need to build ROMS yourself.

 The 'Export' version uses the Catapult network system to transfer export files to Nocturnal. We build the ROM, and send it back to you (no source code is sent).

 See Catapult or Nocturnal's website for more details:
