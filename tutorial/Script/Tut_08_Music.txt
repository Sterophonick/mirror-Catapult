; This tutorial teaches you about : 
;
; i. .mod and .wav files
; ii. Using music and sound resources in Catapult
; 

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Now for a tutorial that will let you really polish your games - adding sound and music! All
; of the details of loading and playing audio are handled by Catapult, so you should have
; no trouble at all with spicing up your games with sound. If you are already familiar with
; MOD and WAV sound formats, you can skip the first section.


; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; MOD and WAV files
;
; Catapult uses two different formats for sound and music: .mod files for music, and
; .wav files for sound.
;
; A. .mod files:
;
; The Catapult music system uses MOD files. MOD is an old format similar to MIDI that
; has largely been replaced by MP3 and other high-quality audio formats. However,
; MOD is the perfect format for doing music on the GBA. Catapult uses the excellent NMod
; system for playing MOD files.
;
; Instead of storing a complete music track as a sound recording, MOD's are stored in
; a sequenced format. This means that each single note is stored with pitch, volume and other
; information, and the MOD player "reads" the file much as a musician reads a piece of
; sheet music.
;
; You may be familiar with MIDI, another sequenced format. The MOD format is
; similar, but unlike MIDI, it stores each instrument internally in the file as a sound sample.
; This means that a MOD file contains all the information needed to recreate the original file
; exactly, using a small amount of space.
;
; Another advantage of MOD files is that you can find freely available software on the internet 
; (such as "ModPlug Tracker") that will let you do produce professional MOD files that can
; be dropped straight into your Catapult programs.
;
;
; B. .wav files :
;
; .wav files are the format that Catapult uses to store sound effects. This is a very common
; format, and all sound recorders should be able to export in WAV.
;
; Like .mod files, .wav files can be used directly by Catapult. All variations of the WAV format
; are supported by Catapult.
;
;


; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Playing sound and music
;
; The following is a basic example of how to get sound/music added to your Catapult project.
;
;
; We use the resource manager to add any new music or sound resources to the project. Lets start with
; a music resource:
;
; 1. Open the resource manager (press Control^R, or select "Resources" from the Assets menu).
;
; 2. Click on the "Clone" button to duplicate an existing resource (i.e. create a new resource).
;
; 3. Change the ID of the newly created resource to "RID_MOD_SONG". 
;
; 4. Change the Type of the resource to 'MOD file'.
;
; 5. Use the browse button, and open the "sounds" directory. Select the file called
; 	"song.mod"
;
; 6. Now close the resource manager. We are now ready to play the song.
;
; Just below this section you can see the tiny main Catapult loop - that is all you need to play music and
; sound! Run the program, and press button A to start playing the song, and button B to stop (these are
; usually mapped to keys 'a' and 's' on a PC).
;

;
; Now, stop the project executing. We are going to repeat the above, but with a sound sample:
;
; 1. Open the resource manager (press Control^R, or select "Resources" from the Assets menu).
;
; 2. Click on the "Clone" button to duplicate an existing resource (i.e. create a new resource).
;
; 3. Change the ID of the newly created resource to "RID_MOD_SAMPLE". 
;
; 4. Change the Type of the resource to 'Sound effect'.
;
; 5. Use the browse button, and open the "sounds" directory. Select the file called
; 	"sample.wav"
;
; 6. Now close the resource manager. 
;
;
;
; Now that we have added the sound to the resource list, we can play it with the SoundPlay command.
;
; But we have to add some code first. Uncomment the lines after the three asterisks (***) in the code below. 
;
; Run the project.
;
; While the project is running, you can trigger the sound by pressing the start button 
; (default key on a PC is "space"). 
;
; Catapult can play up to 8 sounds simultaneously.
;
; Well, wasn't that easy? Now go and put some sound and music into your Catapult games!
